# Converter

A simple Unit Converter Angular app using the [convert-units](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convert-units) npm-module  
Until now, only length conversions are possible.  
Also the Number Input including the Unit Selection could be more generic using a separate Angular Component.  


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
